# Merchandise Recommendation System with Relational Database and Graph Databases
Merchandise Recommendation System is a kind of information filtering system that can predict which merchandises users may need or purchase in future and recommend those merchandises to users. In this project, we implement a Merchandise Recommendation System by using three distinct databases: relational database(clustered and unclustered), Neo4j and OrientDB. The data we use is found online which is a sales records of an online retailer during the whole 2011. After the implementation, we compare the performance of those three databases.
